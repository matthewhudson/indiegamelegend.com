        <p>Indie developers from around the world have gone missing. It’s your job to save them. The future of indie games depends on it.</p>
        <p>Enter an enemy-ridden, dangerous labyrinth and explore five distinct biomes while searching for the answers you need to rescue the indies. Solve puzzles, survive dangerous hazards and obstacles, battle relentless enemies, and uncover the lore of the alien world that blurs the line between game and reality. In the process enter the psyche of a young indie game developer struggling with the social challenges of making games for the love of the medium.</p>
        <p>The Indie Game Legends 3D is based on a 2011 TIGSource forum game created by Paul Hubans, an active member on the TIGSource forums. Hubans was inspired to make an easily digestible game allowing for an outlet to express his insecurities as a game developer but also to connect with friends. The launch of the game was well received but shortly thereafter, fell into obscurity. Jeff Lindsay, also known as progrium and long time friend of Hubans, thought the game was quirky, humor-filled, and nuanced. Lindsay was inspired to see if the two could collaborate to modernize and elevate the game providing a fresh and more immersive game for players.</p>
        <p>“The game is a deeply personal project that’s allowed me to inject humor and lightheartedness, while exploring some of the personal, social, and financial struggles I’ve dealt with in my career as an indie developer,” said Hubans. “Game development is something I’m so passionate about, but it’s certainly not without its challenges. This game has a loosely autobiographical narrative that shows my perspective on that.”</p>
        <p>Hubans and Lindsay both grew up inspired by classic NES games like The Guardian Legend, which the game was originally an homage to, and have always wanted to make a title that allowed for players to enter into one of those worlds from a first person perspective.</p>
        <p>“Paul and I have always wanted to experience what it would feel like to literally be in the world of some of our favorite classic NES games,” said Lindsay. “We wanted to take the concept behind the original 2011 The Indie Game Legend and expand on it, while providing players a feeling of immersion you can only get through a first-person lens. We think since the game is designed more as a classic 8-bit style game more than, say, a retro FPS, the result is something that’s both nostalgic and fresh at the same time.”</p>
        <p>In addition to shifting the gameplay to first-person which greatly changed the game-feel, they added more diverse areas and enemies, and worked to keep the lighthearted gameplay while telling a compelling story. In the full launch version, slated for early 2019, they’ll have four more areas to explore, bringing the total to nine, more enemies, a fully developed story, and plenty of surprises.  </p>
        <p>The Indie Game Legend 3D is available in early access now for $8.99 on the Steam store.</p>
